# TweetGenerator

Description:
A simple python program  that returns a random tweet based on 'keyword' search. 
This program accepts the 'keyword' as a parameter to the python function.
This file uses the twitter search api with a basic streaming template from: http://twittersearch.readthedocs.org/en/v0.78.2/basic_usage.html.

Instructions: 
Download the file tweet-generator.py.
Open the file on any text editor, and there are four keys in the code needed:
consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token and  access_token_secret.
They are currently filled in with x's for security purposes. Enter your own 4 tokens, that can be generated via https://apps.twitter.com/app/new.
After replacing the keys, run the file on your terminal by typing Python tweet-generatory.py.
Then type enter. You will then see a prompt that asks for the correct filename and any keyword you input.
Click enter, and you will see the results of a tweet, the username of that tweeter, and a link if they have one.
